# SQL-Property-Buyer-Trends
A SQL-based data analysis project exploring residential property buyers' demographics across Canadian provinces. This project provides insights into income levels, sale prices, buyer characteristics, and regional trends using various SQL queries and data visualizations.


🏡 Residential Property Buyers: Understanding Demographics Through SQL Analysis 📊

I’m excited to share my latest project where I used SQL to analyze the real estate market and explore the demographics of residential property buyers. This project allowed me to dive deep into understanding how income, sale prices, buyer characteristics, and regional differences shape the housing market.



🔍 Project Name: Residential Property Buyers Demographic Analysis

I worked with a dataset that included information on income, sale prices, buyer demographics (like age, gender, immigrant status), and the number of buyers across various Canadian provinces. Using SQL, I queried the data to uncover key insights into buyer behavior and real estate trends.



📂 Data & Project Details:

- Buyer group types (single, paired, or group buyers)

- Characteristics such as gender, immigrant status, and buyer experience (first-time or seasoned home buyers)

- Average family income and sale prices for 2019-2020

- Regional differences across various provinces



🛠️ Tech Stack:

- SQL for data analysis and querying

- Database design with tables and schema to reflect buyers, property data, income, and sale prices

- PostgreSQL for database management and querying



📊 Key Insights:

Income Disparities:

- New Brunswick had the highest average family income in both 2019 and 2020 at $120,416.

- Manitoba had the lowest at $72,656.



Sale Price Trends:

- New Brunswick saw the largest increase in property prices, with an average rise of $27,597 from 2019 to 2020.

- First-time homebuyers tend to pay more on average, with an average price of $322,781 for properties.



Buyer Demographics:

- Immigrants made up 15% of the buyer population in 2020.

- Single buyers saw the largest increase in property prices from 2019 to 2020, indicating a rising trend among individual buyers.



Regional Market Trends:

- New Brunswick had the most significant rise in the number of property buyers between 2019 and 2020, while Manitoba remained relatively stable.



📈 Real-World Impact: This project demonstrates the power of data-driven insights in the real estate industry. By understanding buyer demographics and market trends, real estate professionals can make informed decisions, tailor their services, and forecast market movements with greater accuracy.
